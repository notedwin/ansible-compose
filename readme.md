# Ansible compose

Ansible compose is some ansible playbooks used to set up infrastructure and applications on local linux boxes.

Ex.
- prod.yml runs on my biggest server, which is a repurposed consumer desktop
- rsp-cam setup a raspberry pi to be an IP camera.

The name ansible compose is due to most of these ansible files being a wrapper ontop of docker compose!
